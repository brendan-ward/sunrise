# Sunrise simulator

I am creating a sunrise simulator lamp to help me wake up in the morning, especially in the winter.

This lamp uses RGB LED strips to provide the light source.  The sunrise simulator will fade in from no light to full daylight spectrum over a defined period, such as 30 minutes.

Devices:
* [Adafruit CircuitPython Express](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express?view=all): used for rapid prototyping and testing the approach
* Arduino Pro Micro: will be used for the final build.

**note**: No assurances are made that any of the code in this repository function properly or do not fry your devices.  Use with caution!
